Clone this repo (or fork it and clone from your own account):

----
git clone https://github.com/paulojeornimo/archlinux-installer
----

Boot Arch Linux (on a virtual machine for example). On its shell, type:

----
$ passwd
$ systemctl start sshd
$ ip a s
----

Edit the link:config[] file and adjust your enviroment settings:

----
$ vim config
----

If you configure your environment to use your own Arch Linux mirror (through {mirror-sync}[archlinux-mirror-synchronizer]) start the HTTP server ({mirror-sync}/blob/master/README.adoc[see how on README.adoc]).

In your machine (outside Arch Linux shell), type:

----
$ ./run
----

Go have some coffee. But come back soon! The Arch Linux installation (depending on what mirror you are using) will be very fast.
